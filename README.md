This template bootstraps CRM-like [Text Platform App](https://platform.text.com/console/apps) with a predefined configuration and code responsible for:

- integration with [LiveChat Widgets](https://platform.text.com/docs/extending-agent-app)
- managing and persisting LiveChat customers using database

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Content

The template is built using:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - web application framework
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - toolkit that simplifies database access and model management
- [Text | Design System](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/design-system-react-components) - shared components library
- [Text Platform | Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-cli) - terminal tool for managing app like in [Developer Console](https://platform.text.com/console)
- [Text Platform | Developer UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-ui-react) - library that provides useful wrappers for:
  - Text Platform App ([@developer-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-sdk#developer-app))
  - Text Products widgets ([@agent-app-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/agent-app-sdk), [@helpdesk-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/helpdesk-sdk))

The template consists of:

- [layout](app/layout.tsx) that wraps all app pages and utilizes [Text Platform | Developer UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-ui-react#-usage) to provide cross-app access to [Text Platform App](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-sdk#developer-app) instance with all of built-in features like [reporting](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-sdk#reporting)
- [page](<app/(products)/livechat/(widgets)/details/page.tsx>) for [LiveChat Details](https://platform.text.com/docs/extending-agent-app#details-section) widget - server component that loads current customer from database (if was already saved)
  - [widget](<app/(products)/livechat/(widgets)/details/widget.tsx>) - client component that presents current customer details and triggers [server actions](prisma/api/index.ts) to save or remove it from database
- [page](<app/(products)/livechat/(widgets)/fullscreen/page.tsx>) for [LiveChat Fullscreen](https://platform.text.com/docs/extending-agent-app#main-menu-fullscreen-app) widget - server component that loads all saved customers from database
  - [widget](<app/(products)/livechat/(widgets)/fullscreen/widget.tsx>) - client component that presents list of saved customers and option to delete customer using [server actions](prisma/api/index.ts) to manage
- [livechat.config.json](livechat.config.json) - contains app manifest that is used by [Text Platform | Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-cli) to manage app
- database
  - [client](lib/prisma.ts) - contains Prisma client which is used by server components and [server actions](prisma/api/index.ts) to read and write to database
  - [schema](prisma/schema.prisma) - Prisma schema file that contains data model for app and specifies how it maps to the underlying database

## üöÄ Getting Started

First, ensure that latest version of [Text Platform | Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livechat/developer-cli) is installed on your machine:

```sh
npm i -g @livechat/developer-cli
```

Then, install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Next, pull latest version of your app manifest:

```sh
txdev app pull
```

You can display your app in [Developer Console](https://platform.text.com/console):

```sh
txdev app open
```

or start local development server running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

### `dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Before running your dev environment don't forget you generate your database models and apply migrations:

```
npm run generate
npm run migrate
```

Keep in mind that Prisma need access to your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` file. Prepare it manually or used `txdev app vars pull` command.
